# Strategy Design Patterns

The Strategy Design Patterns defines a `family of algorithms` `encapsulates each one` 
and `makes them interchangeable`.

* Problem with `Inheritance`
    * Hard to gain knowledge of all the behavior of a Class.
    * Sub-Classes can have different behavior.
    Adding new behavior in the Parent-class can unintentionally affect other sub-Classes.
    * Forces introducing new sub-Classes with new requirements (for example introducing different behaviors).
* Problem with `Interface`
    *
